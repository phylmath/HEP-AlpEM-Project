# Extraction of Î±-em(mZ) at FCC-ee
This repo tracks the progress of my research project studying a novel method of extracting the electromagnetic coupling constant from electron-positron collisions at the Z-pole in the FCC-ee collider. The analyses are mainly in C++ using the Pythia 8.312, ROOT 6.32.08, and Delphes 3.5.0 frameworks.
